## 3. Structure of the Periodic Table
The periodic table is divided into rows (periods) and columns (groups or families). Each element is represented by its chemical symbol, atomic number, and atomic weight.

- **Periods:** Horizontal rows indicating the number of electron shells.
- **Groups:** Vertical columns that share similar chemical properties.

**Keywords:** structure of periodic table, periods, groups, chemical properties

## 4. Understanding Element Categories
Elements in the periodic table are categorized into several groups:

- **Metals:** Good conductors of heat and electricity (e.g., Iron, Gold).
- **Nonmetals:** Poor conductors, often gases at room temperature (e.g., Oxygen, Nitrogen).
- **Metalloids:** Exhibit properties of both metals and nonmetals (e.g., Silicon, Arsenic).
- **Noble Gases:** Inert gases with very low reactivity (e.g., Helium, Neon).

**Keywords:** metals, nonmetals, metalloids, noble gases
